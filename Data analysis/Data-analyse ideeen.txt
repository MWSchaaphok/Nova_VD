Data analysis ideas:

	Read information from www.datamc.org 

General:
	-> Motorcycle set-up/race information sheet
		-> Examples available at ww.datamc.org/downloads
	-> User friendly
		-> Multiple channels at once -> option to overlap in one graph
		-> GUI drop down manuals of what to show
	-> Good documentation
	-> Compare laps vs showing one lap/data set
	-> Seperate laps from the data


Sensors:
	Must haves:
		Accelerometer	-> accelerations
		Gps 		-> position, velocity
		Gyroscope 	-> lean angle
	Should haves:
		Wheel speed	-> acceleration
		Suspension potentiometer

-> Divide the track into logical sectors 
	-> make it easy to change sector definitions?

Graphs 
	-> Distance - X plots
		- Speed
		- RPM (note RPM is lightly dependent on the lean angle)
		- Acceleration (longitudinal/lateral)
			
	-> X-Y plots
	-> Histograms 
		- RPM
		- Suspension
		- Throttle position
	-> Rate of change channels
